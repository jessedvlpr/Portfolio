                    <h2>Hello, I'm Jesse, a Computer Programmer and 'IoT Tinkerer'.</h2><br>
                    I am a Computer Programmer because I've graduated from the Computer Programming course at Algonquin
                    College of Applied Arts and Technology. There, I earned myself a Ontario College Diploma, as well as
                    a spot on the Dean's list for all 4 of the semesters in the program. This website/portfolio is a
                    testement of the skills that I've learned from my time there, as well as my own personal skill
                    development.<br><br>
                    I'm an IoT Tinkerer because I enjoy tinkering with some hobbyist devices like the Raspberry PI,
                    Arduino, and the ESP32. I've been tinkering with IoT devices for about 1 year, making little
                    projects I would find fun, such as a RP2040 with a fingerprint sensor that activates an
                    electro-magnetic lock when the right fingerprint is detected. I've also used an ESP32 to make some
                    similar projects but now including WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities.<br><br>
                    I have many more interests in the general field of computers, not just programming, but that's what
                    I'm best at. If any of that piques your interest, click on the Contact ribbon above and shoot me a
                    message.

                        <p>Java is my most familiar language. I learned Java in my highschool computer science classes,
                            as well as my college classes, and continuing to use it now, totalling about <strong>4
                                years</strong> of using Java.</p>

                            portfolio site was built using just those three technolgies. I started learning JavaScript
                            about <strong>2 years</strong> ago, and it has become been my most used language for the
                            time being, since it has the convenience of having the all-in-one GUI technology of a web
                            browser. CSS and HTML started at about the same time, as it seemed the natural course for
                            outputting any of the JavaScript code I wrote.</p>

                            experience in android. But I picked it up very fast, with it being one of my favourite

                            and uploaded to github, this I make a point of as it has helped much in the past in not only
                            tracking who gets things done and when, but also provides a great safety net to any project
                            that has any sensitive infrascructure behind it. With git, you can always keep a backup of
                            the stable, working code without causing any damage.</p>
                        <p>Docker is also listed as a DevOps tool, I learned docker (as well as kubernets but I couldn't
                            find an image for it) in my last year of school and have been playing around with it on and
                            off since then, totalling about <strong>1 year.</strong></p>

                            include, despite not listing 'Windows' even though that is my most used OS. The ability to
                            navigate and manipulate Linux effectively can be a vital skill when the tool I am hired to
                            work on is either partially or wholly available in linux. I've had an interest in linux
                            since highschool when I learned Windows wasn't the only thing out there. I have around
                            <strong>3 years</strong> experience troubleshooting Operating Systems and making them work
                            on my various systems.

                            different kind. MySQL being an RDBMS, Oracle being Multi-model, and Mongo being
                            document-based. Working with all 3 types like this is a great asset, as it gave me much

                    I've graduated from the Computer Programming course at Algonquin College of Applied Arts and
                    Technology, with a final GPA of 3.88. The reason for it being lower than a 4.0 was to do with the
                    complications of online learning during covid, and should not diminish the opinion of my skills in
                    programming.<br><br>
                    I also earned myself a spot on the Dean's List for all 4 of the semesters in the course, despite
